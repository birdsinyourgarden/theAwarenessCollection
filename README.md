# Description 🗺️

Personal project in which I have developed the Frontend of a website about documentaries, called The Awareness Collection. The data is taken from a JSON server.

***We need to educate ourselves, raise awareness in others, and embrace the small steps people take in learning more about different issues. For many, the seeds of change are first planted by a great documentary that informs and compels them to act.***
